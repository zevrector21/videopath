Hi there,

We'd love for you to get the most out of using Videopath, but I noticed you haven't logged in for a while. Is there anything I can help you with? 

I also wanted to share this quick Videopath project with you: http://player.videopath.com/USH9PstU/. Enjoy! 
Thanks again for signing up and let us know if you have any questions or feedback!

Happy Videomaking,
Rée

PS - In case you need it again, here's the link to our video builder app: https://app.videopath.com  
and our website: http://www.videopath.com

Kind Regards,
Rée
