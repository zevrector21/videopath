Hi there,

Thanks again for signing up! I noticed that you haven't logged in for some time and I wanted to see if you needed help getting set up with Videopath. Please take a look at our Tutorial and Documentation page - https://videopath.com/documentation/ - for some tips on how to get started or reach out directly so we can set up a demo/call.

We look forward to hearing from you. 

Happy Videomaking,
RÃ©e

PS - In case you need it again, here's the link to our video builder app: https://app.videopath.com
