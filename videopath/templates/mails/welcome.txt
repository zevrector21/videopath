Hi,

I saw that you’ve signed up for our Videopath tool. How’s it going? Do you need help with anything?

I’m interested in hearing about your experience so far, so please send me any thoughts or questions you have -- whether you’ve just signed up, want to see a specific feature, or need help publishing and distributing your video.

We’re happy to have you using Videopath - thanks for trying us out.

Thanks,
Dave

PS - In case you need it again, here's the link to our video builder app: https://app.videopath.com
