Hi,

I saw that you’ve signed up for Videopath. How’s it going? Do you need help with anything?

I’m interested in hearing about your experience so far so please send me any thoughts or questions you may have — whether you’ve just signed up, want to see a specific feature, or need help publishing and distributing your video.

In case you need it again, here's the link to our video builder app: https://app.videopath.com and our website: http://www.videopath.com.

Happy interactive video-making!

Kind Regards,
Rée
